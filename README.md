# wdi-10-Project-2-Bookshelves

## What is Bookshelves?
Bookshelves allows readers to organize their current, future and past reads! They will also be able to create and manage their own bookclubs to connect and share new adventures on the page. 

## Why Bookshelves?
With so many great books out there it's hard to keep track of them all, and in the digital age it can be difficult to find someone who's interested in the same book as you. Bookshelves provides readers with a quick and efficient way to track what they're currently reading, have read, and would like to read all in one place - much like a book shelf in your house (but better organized...). Plus you can discover new books, created custom shelves based on your interests and connect with other readers through bookclubs.
